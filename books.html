  <h2>FAVORITE BOOKS</h2>
  <p>There are several books we come across, but not everything stays in our mind or inspires us.</p>
  <h2>The books that inspired me are:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>THE ALCHEMIST</h4>
    </li>
    <p>The boy who taught me our heart knows the best for us. And when we travel the destined path</p>
    <p>the universe will help us get there.<a

    <li>
      <h4>TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD</h4>
    </li>
    <p>The family that inspired me to stand for anything I believe that is right and doesn't harm anyone</p>
    <p>irrespective of the societal norms and rules, as long as our beliefs help someone it's absolutely necessary</p>
    <p>fine to stand for it.</p><a href="  https://www.amazon.com/Kill-Mockingbird-Harper-Lee/dp/0446310786"><em>buy the book</em></a>
